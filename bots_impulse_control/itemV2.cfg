title = "Bot Improvements - Impulse Control";
description = "[b]Allows you to disable or control some aspects of bot behaviour.  In particular, provides the option of manually controlling their use of healing items.[/b]

Sometimes the bots seem to suffer from poor impulse control - like when they go haring off after a lurking Globadier instead of dealing with more immediate problems, or when they gulp down the party's last healing item while they still have a good chunk of green health left. This mod gives you a few options to force them to show some restraint.

All options are off by default; go to the Mod Options screen to enable them, and to set the keybindings for manual healing control.
