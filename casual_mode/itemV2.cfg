description = "This mod allows you to bypass the loot and progression system to gain immediate access to full-power heroes and weapons.  It will only ever be usable in the modded realm.  It's mostly aimed at pre-made teams where one or more of the players don't have the time to grind through the progression in the official realm.

By default, the mod offers a simple progression where the player starts off with one career unlocked for each hero, along with a minimal number of weapons, talents, properties, and traits.  Additional careers, weapons etc. can be unlocked using experience points gained from playing missions.  There is no 'power' progression, all careers and items begin at maximum power.  The progression is quite rapid - a single full-book Champion run will give enough XP to unlock a career, or two weapons, or four properties, for example.

There is also an option to disable even the simple progression, in which case everything will be unlocked immediately.

Progress already made in the official realm carries over to the simple progression system.  That is, careers, weapons, and talents available to you in the official realm will still be available with this mod.  For anyone who has fully leveled up careers and items in the official realm, this mod is mostly pointless - it's intended more for your friends who just play casually.  However, there is an option to ignore official-realm progress, in case you want to grind through the simple progression anyway for some reason.

Item creation and modification is integrated into the existing crafting UI (see screenshots above).  The mod doesn't automatically create any items for you, just use the crafting UI to create what you want.  When something is locked, simply click on it and you will be shown a dialog allowing you to spend the XP to unlock it.

Note that if you just want to make full-power items in the modded realm, the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1425249043]Give Weapon[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1687843693]Save Weapon[/url] mods (by prop joe and Zero) may be a better option for you.
