Note: item traits and properties, and talents, will only be shown for connected players if they are also using this mod.

Version: 1.0.3
Changelist:
1.0.3: Disable the mod during Weaves so it doesn't crash the game, and avoid spewing error messages when the game claims there are more than 4 players.
1.0.2: Update for patch 2.0 of the game (support 6th talent for level 35 heroes).
1.0.1: Possible fix for network problems, and small adjustment of vertical positioning of widgets

People have reported that the host sometimes does not show the extra info (talents and item properties/traits) for connected clients.  I haven't been able to reproduce this, so if someone finds a reproducible test case, let me know.
